# FileInventories

FileInventories is a [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fileinventories.52061/) and [Sponge](https://ore.spongepowered.org/RedNesto/FileInventories) plugin letting server owners design inventories within JSON files.

The [Wiki](https://github.com/RedNesto/FileInventories/wiki) is here to help you, whether you are a server owner, or a developer wanting to integrate your plugin to this API.

You can join me on [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/zUgFWV8) if you have any question or feature request, but please report any bug in the issue tracker of this repository.
